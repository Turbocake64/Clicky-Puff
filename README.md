## How to Play
Users click any character to start. The goal of the game is to only click each character once, with the highest possible score being 12. Every time you make a guess, the characters will reshuffle themselves. They won't forget that you clicked them so you better not either! If you accidentally click the same character twice, KAPOW! You loose and the game resets. Keep track of your score, losses, and high score in the nav bar at the top of the page. The link on the top left in the nav bar resets your score and re-loads the page.
